Set #1
-------------------------------------

The following questions make up Set #1 of the Practice Exam Questions. The questions resemble, both in format and substance, what you might see on the AP CS Principles exam. You should finish these questions within 17 minutes to satisfy the time constraints of the AP exam. You may refer to the official AP CS Reference Sheet during the exam, provided by the College Board, which can be found |link|.

Click the "Start" button when you are ready to begin the exam.  Click the "Pause" button to pause the exam (you will not be able to see the questions when the exam is paused).  It will show how much time you have used, but you have unlimited time.  Click on the "Finish Exam" button at the end when you are done.  The number correct, number wrong, and number skipped will be displayed at the bottom of the page.  Feedback for each answer will also be shown as well as your answer.

You will not be able to change your answers after you hit the "Finish Exam" button.

       Which of the following statements are true regarding compressing files?
       ::

        I. If lossless compression is applied, every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed.
        II. No matter what compression technique is used, once a data file is compressed, it cannot be restored to its original state.
        III. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is often much higher than through lossless techniques.

       A programmer is writing code to switch the values of two integer variables, namely ``a`` and ``b``, using a temporary integer variable, ``temp``. This is the pseudo-code that the programmer has come up with:
       ::

        temp ← a  # statement 1.
        b ← temp  # statement 2.
        a ← b     # statement 3.

       Will the pseudo-code correctly perform the required task (assume that ``a`` and ``b`` are never numerically equal)?
