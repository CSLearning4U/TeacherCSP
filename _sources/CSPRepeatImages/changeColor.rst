Changing Step 5: Increasing and decreasing color values

Below is a selection of images that you can use in the programs in this section.

First example: Let's change STEP 5, so that we decrease the red by 50%.

.. activecode:: Image_Decrease_Red
    :tour_1: "Important Lines Tour"; 2: timg5-line2; 5: timg5-line5; 8-9: timg5-line8-9; 12: timg5-line12; 15: timg5-line15; 18: timg5-line18; 21-22: timg5-line21-22;
    :nocodelens: 

    # STEP 1: USE THE IMAGE LIBRARY 
    from image import *
    
    # STEP 2: PICK THE IMAGE
    img = Image("beach.jpg")

    # STEP 3: LOOP THROUGH THE PIXELS
    pixels = img.getPixels();
    for p in pixels:
        
    	# STEP 4: GET THE DATA
        r = p.getRed()
            
        # STEP 5: MODIFY THE COLOR
        p.setRed(r * 0.5);
            
        # STEP 6: UPDATE THE IMAGE 
        img.updatePixel(p)
            
    # STEP 7: SHOW THE RESULT
    win = ImageWin(img.getWidth(),img.getHeight())
    img.draw(win)

Try the program above on some of the other images by changing the name of the image file on line 5.  What effect does it always have?  Is this what you expected when we decrease the red?

We can *increase* the red in a similar way. Let's change STEP 5, so that we increase the red by 150%.

.. activecode:: Image_Increase_Red
    :tour_1: "Important Lines Tour"; 2: timg5-line2; 5: timg5-line5; 8-9: timg5-line8-9; 12: timg5-line12; 15: timg6-line15; 18: timg5-line18; 21-22: timg5-line21-22; 
    :nocodelens:

    # STEP 1: USE THE IMAGE LIBRARY 
    from image import *
    
    # STEP 2: PICK THE IMAGE
    img = Image("beach.jpg")

    # STEP 3: LOOP THROUGH THE PIXELS
    pixels = img.getPixels()
    for p in pixels:
        
    	# STEP 4: GET THE DATA
        r = p.getRed()
            
        # STEP 5: MODIFY THE COLOR
        p.setRed(r * 1.5)
            
        # STEP 6: UPDATE THE IMAGE
        img.updatePixel(p)
            
    # STEP 7: SHOW THE RESULT
    win = ImageWin(img.getWidth(),img.getHeight())
    img.draw(win)

Try the program above on some of the other images by changing the name of the image file on line 5.   What effect does it always have? Is this what you expected when you increase the red?  What happens if you increase two colors at the same time?

.. note ::

   The problem below has blocks connected by purple edges.  Pick just one of the blocks to use in the solution.  One is the correct block and one is a *distractor* which is not needed in a correct solution.

.. parsonsprob:: Image_Decrease_GB

   Another way to get a similar effect to increasing the red, is to decrease the green and blue by 25%.  Figure out how to do that in the program above and then use that information to drag the needed code blocks below from the left to the right in the correct order with the correct indention. There may be extra blocks that are not needed in a correct solution.  Click on the *Check Me* button to check your solution.
