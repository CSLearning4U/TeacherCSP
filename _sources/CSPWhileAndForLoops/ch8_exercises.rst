    .. tabbed:: ch8ex1t

        .. tab:: Question

            Fix the 5 syntax errors in the code below to print a countdown of the numbers from 10 to 0.

            .. activecode:: ch8ex1q
                :nocodelens:

                counter = 10
                while Counter > 0:
                    Print(counter)
                    counter = Counter + 1

        .. tab:: Answer

            Change ``Counter`` to ``counter`` on lines 2 and 4.  Loop while ``counter`` is greater than or equal to 0.  Change the ``Print`` to ``print``.  Change the last line to subtract one rather than add it.

            .. activecode:: ch8ex1a
                :nocodelens:

                counter = 10
                while counter >= 0:
                    print(counter)
                    counter = counter - 1

    .. tabbed:: ch8ex2t

        .. tab:: Question

            The following code will loop infinitely. Make one change that will make it loop only 5 times.

            .. activecode::  ch8ex2q
                :nocodelens:

                x = 5
                while x > 0:
                    print(x)
                    x = x + 1

        .. tab:: Answer

            Since, x is already greater than zero, it will keep looping. Change line 4 to be ``x = x - 1``.

            .. activecode::  ch8ex2a
                :nocodelens:

                x = 5
                while x > 0:
                    print(x)
                    x = x - 1

    .. tabbed:: ch8ex3t

        .. tab:: Question

           Make 5 changes to the code below to correctly print a count up from -10 to 0.

           .. activecode::  ch8ex3q
                :nocodelens:

                output = ""
                x = -10
                while x < 0
                    x = x - 1
                output = output + str(x) + " "
                print(output)


        .. tab:: Answer

            Change the ``while`` to less than or equal zero.  Add a ``:`` at the end.  Change it to ``x = x + 1`` and move it after ``output = output + str(x) + " "``.  Indent the ``output = output + str(x) + " "``.

            .. activecode::  ch8ex3a

    .. tabbed:: ch8ex4t


        .. tab:: Question

            Fix the errors in the code below so that it uses 2 loops to print 8 lines of ``*``.

            .. activecode::  ch8ex4q
                :nocodelens:

                for x in range(1,2)

                while y < 4:
                print("*")
                y += 1

        .. tab:: Answer

            The first loop should be from range 0 to 2 (or any two numbers that are 2 numbers apart). Line 1 should also have a colon at the end and line 2 and 3 should be indented. Line 4 and 5 should be indented 8 spaces.

                    x =
                print(output)


        .. tab:: Answer

            Change line 1 to set output to the empty string (``""``).  Change line 5 to ``x = x + 1``.

                print()

        .. tab:: Answer

            Line 4 should be ``x = x + 1`` and line 6 should print x.

        .. tab:: Answer

            Don't indent line 2.  Indent line 6 under line 5.  Indent line 7 at the same level as line 5.  Don't indent line 8.

    .. tabbed:: ch8ex8t

        .. tab:: Question

            The function currently takes a start and stop argument and uses a for loop to find the sum of all the numbers between them (inclusive). Change the for loop to a while loop while still using the parameters.

            .. activecode::  ch8ex8q
                :nocodelens:

                def sumFunc(start, stop):
                    sum = 0
                    for num in range(start, stop + 1):
                        sum = sum + num
                    return sum

                print(sumFunc(1,10))

        .. tab:: Answer

            Initialize num to be equal to the start argument. Make the while loop check to see if num is less than or equal to the stop argument. In the body of the while loop, make sure to increment num by 1.

            .. activecode::  ch8ex8a
                :nocodelens:

                    num = start
                    while num <= stop:
                        sum = sum + num
                        num = num + 1

        .. tab:: Answer

            Change line 1 to end the range at 4.  Change line 2 to end the range at 11 and add the ``:`` at the end.  Fill in the missing ``+`` between strings in line 3 and add ``str(x*y)``.

 	    The code below currently enters a loop where it keeps printing "Even". Fix the code so that it prints "Even" and "Odd" for numbers 0 to 9.
 	    
            .. activecode::  ch8ex14q
                :nocodelens:

		number = 0
		while number < 10:
		    while number % 2 == 0:
		        print("Even")
		    while number % 2 != 0:
		        print("Odd")
		    number += 1
		    
        .. tab:: Answer

	    You have to increment the counter in the body of each inner loop.

		    while number % 2 != 0:
		        print("Odd")

        .. tab:: Question

           Modify the code below to create a function that will take numbers as input until you enter a negative number and then will return the average of the numbers.

           .. activecode::  ch8ex15q
                :nocodelens:

                sum = 0
                count = 0
                message = "Enter an integer or a negative number to stop"
                value = input(message)
                while int(value) > 0:
                    print("You entered " + value)
                    sum = sum + int(value)
                    count = count + 1
                    value = input(message)
                print("The sum is: " + str(sum) +
                      " the average is: " + str(sum / count))

        .. tab:: Answer

            Define the function.  Return the sum divided by the count.  Call the function and print the result.

                    message = "Enter an integer or a negative number to stop"
                    value = input(message)
                    while int(value) > 0:
                        print("You entered " + value)
                        sum = sum + int(value)
                        count = count + 1
                        value = input(message)
                    return(sum / count)

            Change the range in line 1 from -10 to 0 and add the colon. Fix the indentation in the rest of the lines and in line 3 change the string and operator to reflect division

            Write a procedure that takes a user input and keeps asking for a user input until the input is "Hello". If the input is not "Hello", it should print "This is your n wrong try." where n is the number of times they have put an input in. If they type "Hello", the procedure should print "Success!". Hint: ``!=`` means does not equal

            .. activecode::  ch8ex18q
                :nocodelens:


        .. tab:: Answer

            In the procedure, get an input and initialize the count. Then create the while loop with the condition that the input does not equal "Hello". Increment count first in the loop if count was initialized as 0. Increment it last if count was initialized as 1. Ask for input again in the body of the while loop.
