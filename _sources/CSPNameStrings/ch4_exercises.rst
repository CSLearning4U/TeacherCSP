    .. tabbed:: ch4ex1t

        .. tab:: Question

            There are 3 syntax errors in the following code.  Fix it to print correctly without errors. It will print, "Your name is Carly and your favorite color is red".

            .. activecode:: ch4ex1q
                :nocodelens:

                color = "red'
                name = 'Carly'
                print("Your name is " + name +
                      and your favorite color is" + color + ".")

        .. tab:: Answer

            Change ``"red'`` to ``"red"``.  Add an ``"`` before ``and your favorite``.  Add a space after ``is``.

            .. activecode:: ch4ex1a
                :nocodelens:

                color = "red"

    .. tabbed:: ch4ex2t

        .. tab:: Question

            Fix the syntax errors so it prints "My name is Sam and I am 12 years old."

            .. activecode::  ch4ex2q
                :nocodelens:

                name = Sam
                age = 12
                print("My name is name and I am" + age + "years old".)

        .. tab:: Answer

            ``Sam`` must be a string because otherwise it's a variable. Age must be converted to a string.

            .. activecode::  ch4ex2a
                :nocodelens:

                name = "Sam"
                age = 12
                print("My name is " + name +" and I am " + str(age) + " years old.")

                     "and your age is" + age + ".")

        .. tab:: Answer

            Change ``age`` to ``str(age)``.

            You only want the substring from character 11 to character 26, but remember the stop sequence isn't inclusive.

            Calculate ``numGallons`` as ``tankCapacity * 0.25``.  Calculate ``numMiles`` as ``numGallons * milesPerGallon``.  Use concatenation to print out an explanation and the value.  Be sure to use ``str(num)`` to convert a number to a string before you concatenate it.

           Write the code below to calculate and print how many months it will take to save $200 if you earn $20 a week.  It should print: "It will take 2.5 months to earn 200 if you make 20 dollars a week."

                :nocodelens:

        .. tab:: Answer

            Name each of the values.  Calculate the ``totalWeeks`` it will take and the ``months`` and print the information.

                goal = 200
                weeklyEarning = 20
                totalWeeks = goal / weeklyEarning
                months = totalWeeks / 4
                print("It will take " + str(months) + " months to earn " +
                       str(goal) + " if you make " + str(weeklyEarning) +
                       " dollars a week.")

        .. tab:: Question

            Write code to print out the statement "Hi my name is Bob and I am 2" using only string methods or string slicing. You must get every part of the new string from the given strings.

            .. activecode::  ch4ex18q
                :nocodelens:

                s1 = "hi"
                s2 = "My namesake is Bob, and he and I love to eat ham."

        .. tab:: Answer

            Use string slicing to get all the words and get the length of ``s1`` to get the number 2. Use methods like capitalize() and lower() to convert cases.

            .. activecode::  ch4ex18a
                :nocodelens:

		s1 = "hi"
                s2 = "My namesake is Bob, and he and I love to eat ham."
                s3 = s1.capitalize()
                s4 = s2[0:7].lower()
                s5 = s2[12:18]
                s6 = s2[31:33]
                s7 = s2[46:48]
                s8 = len(s1)
                print(s3 + " " + s4 + " " + s5 + " " + s6 + s7 + " " + str(s8))

        .. tab:: Question

           Write code below to get at least 3 values from the user using the ``input`` function and output a mad lib (which will use the input to tell a silly story).

           .. activecode::  ch4ex19q
               :nocodelens:

        .. tab:: Answer

            Use ``input("message")`` to get the input.  Use string concatenation to print the mad lib.

                place = input("Enter the name of a place.")
                verb = input("Enter a verb.")
                action = input("Enter an action.")
                color = input("Enter your favorite color.")
                animal = input("What is your favorite animal?")
                print("Once upon a time in " + place + ", I was " +

            Write code that gets user input and print a string that states their input in all lowercase and gives the length of their string.

            Use the lower and length methods on the user input. Don't forget to convert the length to a string.
